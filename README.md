Solana Javascript npm at   https://www.npmjs.com/package/@solana/web3.js


Presently version 1.73.0

```
<!-- Development (un-minified) -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@solana/web3.js@latest/lib/index.iife.js"></script>

<!-- Production (minified) -->
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@solana/web3.js@latest/lib/index.iife.min.js"></script>


So best to use 

<script src="https://unpkg.com/@solana/web3.js@1.73.0/lib/index.iife.js"></script>

and then update it as new releases are proved to work


```
